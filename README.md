>This is the code reference page of the paper "A New Language and Hidden Markov Input/Output Model for Automated Audit Inquiry". 
>    
>An "Auditor Inquiry - Client Response" data sample is also available in this repository.     
>    
>The program is built using Dr. Mogeng Yin's [Input Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM) Python package](https://github.com/Mogeng/IOHMM).      
### Data Description

>The sample data have 52 communicating dyads simulating the auditor-client communication process.
>
>In this dataset, there are 7 auditor inquiries, coded as _I1, I2, ..., I7_. There are more than 21 client responses, coded as _R1, R2,..., R21_, as sometimes a client response was logged as a "partial response". For instance, a response which beared resemblance to response R1 was recorded as a "R1P" response ("P" for "Partial").
